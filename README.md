# Snake Game
   
    -> This "Snake Game" works a little bit different from the usual, your goal is to put some obstacles on the table, 
       choose an starting point for the snake to generate, and make the snake move a "x-number" positions.
    -> The Snake moves randomly, so you will need some luck.
    -> You win if the snake finishes all the movements without being stuck at any obstacle, or itself.
